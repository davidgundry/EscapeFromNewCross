Escape From New Cross
=====================

Escape from New Cross is a third person Pac-man-like maze game made in Unity. It is inspired by London Underground stations (including, of course, New Cross). The mazes are randomly generated at runtime using the Recursive Division algorithm. The ghosts have three separate behaviours. Character animation uses motion capture data. Ghost sounds make use of Unity's 3D sound processing capabilities.

Developed by Joe Cutting and David Gundry for the Game Development for IGGI course at Goldsmiths, University of London.
